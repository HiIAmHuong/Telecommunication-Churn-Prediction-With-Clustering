# Dataset

The data set includes information about:
-	Services has been signed up for: phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
-	Demographic information: gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
-	Customer account information: tenure mean how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
-	The last is our target, customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
